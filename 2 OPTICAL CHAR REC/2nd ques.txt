To load the built-in dataset of handwritten digits (0–9).

5. What type of problem is digit recognition?

Classification problem.

🔵 CELL 2 — Loading the Digits Dataset
Cell Code (summary)
digits = load_digits()
X = digits.data
y = digits.target

Questions & Answers
1. What does load_digits() return?

It gives images of handwritten digits.

2. What is X?

Flattened pixel values of each digit image.

3. What is y?

The actual digit label (0–9).

4. Why are digit images converted into numbers?

Because ANN can only understand numeric data.

5. How many samples are in the dataset?

1797 digit images.

🔵 CELL 3 — Visualizing a Digit
Cell Code (summary)
plt.imshow(digits.images[0], cmap='gray')
plt.title(y[0])
plt.show()

Questions & Answers
1. Why do we use imshow()?

To display a digit image on screen.

2. Why use cmap='gray'?

To show the digit in black & white.

3. What does digits.images[0] mean?

The first digit image from the dataset.

4. Why do we show the label using title()?

So we know what digit the image represents.

5. What does plt.show() do?

It prints the image.

🔵 CELL 4 — Creating the ANN Model
Cell Code (summary)
model = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(50,), activation='relu', max_iter=500)

Questions & Answers
1. What does hidden_layer_sizes=(50,) mean?

One hidden layer with 50 neurons.

2. Why use ReLU activation?

It makes training faster and avoids vanishing gradients.

3. Why max_iter=500?

To allow more training steps for better accuracy.

4. Is MLPClassifier suitable for OCR?

Yes, because ANN can learn digit patterns.

5. Is this deep learning?

Not exactly — it is a simple ANN, not a CNN.

🔵 CELL 5 — Training the Model
Cell Code (summary)
model.fit(X, y)

Questions & Answers
1. What does fit() do?

It trains ANN on digit images.

2. What does the model learn during training?

Patterns of pixel values that represent each digit.

3. Which algorithm is used to update weights?

Backpropagation.

4. Why do we give X and y?

X = inputs (image pixels)
y = correct digit labels

5. What will output be after training?

A trained ANN ready to predict new digits.

🔵 CELL 6 — Predicting a Digit
Cell Code (summary)
prediction = model.predict([X[0]])
print(prediction)

Questions & Answers
1. What does predict() do?

It guesses what digit an image represents.

2. Why pass X[0]?

To test recognition on the first digit.

3. What will prediction contain?

A number between 0–9 (predicted digit).

4. How does ANN decide the digit?

By comparing learned pixel patterns.

5. Why wrap X[0] inside brackets [ ]?

predict() expects 2D input.

🔵 CELL 7 — Checking Accuracy
Cell Code (summary)
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
y_pred = model.predict(X)
print(accuracy_score(y, y_pred))

Questions & Answers
1. What is accuracy_score?

A function to measure how correct the model is.

2. What is y_pred?

Predicted digits for all images.

3. Why compare y and y_pred?

To calculate accuracy.

4. What accuracy does ANN usually achieve on digits data?

Around 95%+.

5. Why check accuracy?

To ensure the model is performing well.

🟣 GENERAL OCR + ANN QUESTIONS (VIVA)

(Simple questions external examiner can ask)

1. What is OCR?

OCR means converting images of text into actual text.

2. Why ANN for OCR?

Because ANN can recognize patterns like shapes of digits.

3. Why reshape images into 1D arrays?

ANN needs input in a single vector.

4. Why do digits dataset images have 8×8 pixels?

This is the size of the built-in dataset.

5. Why ANN instead of CNN?

Simple ANN is enough for small datasets.

6. What is the output of ANN in digit recognition?

A number between 0 and 9.

7. What activation functions can we use?

ReLU, sigmoid, tanh.

8. What is one-hot encoding?

A way to represent classes in binary form.

9. What happens if max_iter is too low?

The model may not train fully.

10. Why normalize image pixels?

To help ANN train better.
