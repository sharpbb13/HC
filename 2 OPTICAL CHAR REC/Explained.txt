CELL 1 – Import Libraries

This cell imports all the required modules:
- numpy, matplotlib  →  numerical operations & plotting
- load_digits  →  built-in digits dataset (8×8 pixel images)
- train_test_split  →  split dataset
- StandardScaler  →  normalize features
- Sequential, Dense, Dropout  →  building ANN
- to_categorical  →  convert labels to one-hot format


CELL 2 – Load Digits Dataset

-  Loads digits dataset using load_digits().
-  X = digits.data (1797 samples × 64 features → flattened 8×8 images)
-  y = digits.target (labels: 0–9 digits)
-  Prints shapes to confirm dataset loaded properly.


CELL 3 – Display Sample Images

-  Plots 10 sample digit images using imshow().
-  Each image is shown in grayscale along with its true label.


CELL 4 – Preprocessing

a) Standardizing Data - 
-  Uses StandardScaler to scale X.
-  Neural networks work better when data is normalized.

b) One-hot Encode Labels
-  Converts y to 10-class one-hot vectors using to_categorical().

c) Train–test Split
-  Splits dataset into:
     -- 80% training
     -- 20% testing
- stratify=y ensures equal distribution of classes.


CELL 5 – Build ANN Model

A fully connected neural network is created:
-  Input Layer: 64 neurons (one per pixel)
-  Hidden Layer 1 + Dropout: learns features & avoids overfitting
-  Hidden Layer 2: more feature extraction
-  Output Layer: 10 neurons (one for each digit)
-  Compiled with:
      - adam optimizer
      - categorical crossentropy for multi-class classification


CELL 6 – Train the Model

Trains ANN using:
   --  20 epochs
   --  batch_size = 32
   --  Uses test data as validation.
- Shows training accuracy & validation accuracy improving with epochs.


CELL 7 – Plot Accuracy & Loss

Creates two plots:
1. Accuracy vs Epochs (Train & Validation)
2. Loss vs Epochs (Train & Validation)


CELL 8 – Evaluate the Model

-  Computes final Test Loss and Test Accuracy.
-  Accuracy is around 97%, which is excellent for digits dataset.


CELL 9 – Predictions Visualization

-  Predicts classes for test images.
-  Displays first 10 test images with:
     -  Predicted label
     -  True label
