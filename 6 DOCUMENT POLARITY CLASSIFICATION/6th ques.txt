PART A — CELL-WISE SHORT QUESTIONS (EASY & DIRECT)

(These are asked directly from the code cells)

📌 Cell 1 — Importing Libraries
Q1. Why do we import pandas?

To read and handle text data easily in table form.

Q2. Why do we import sklearn?

To use machine learning tools like vectorizers and classifiers.

Q3. What is CountVectorizer?

It converts text into numbers by counting each word.

📌 Cell 2 — Loading the Dataset
Q4. Why do we use pd.read_csv() here?

To load our text dataset from a CSV file into a DataFrame.

Q5. What columns does the dataset contain?

It usually contains:

Text/document

Label/polarity (positive or negative)

Q6. What does data.head() show?

The first 5 rows of the dataset.

📌 Cell 3 — Checking Missing Values
Q7. Why do we use isnull().sum()?

To check if any text or label is missing.

Q8. Why must missing values be cleaned?

Because models can't work on empty text.

📌 Cell 4 — Text Cleaning
Q9. Why do we convert text to lowercase?

To make words uniform (e.g., Good = GOOD = good).

Q10. Why do we remove punctuation?

Because punctuations do not affect meaning.

Q11. Why do we remove stopwords?

Stopwords like and, the, is, was do not add meaning to classification.

📌 Cell 5 — Splitting Data
Q12. Why do we use train_test_split()?

To keep some data for training and some for testing.

Q13. What is test_size=0.2?

20% of data will be used for testing.

📌 Cell 6 — Vectorization
Q14. Why do we use CountVectorizer?

To convert cleaned text into numerical form.

Q15. What does fit_transform() do?

Learns vocabulary and converts text to numeric vectors.

Q16. What is X_train.shape?

It shows number of documents and number of words used as features.

📌 Cell 7 — Model Training
Q17. Which model is used for classification?

It may be:

Naive Bayes

Logistic Regression

SVM
(any suitable model)

Q18. Why do we fit the model?

To teach the model how positive and negative documents look.

📌 Cell 8 — Model Prediction
Q19. What does model.predict() do?

Predicts whether a new document is positive or negative.

Q20. Why do we test on X_test?

To check accuracy on unseen data.

📌 Cell 9 — Accuracy
Q21. Why do we use accuracy_score()?

To measure how many predictions are correct.

Q22. What is a good accuracy for text polarity tasks?

Generally 70%–90% is acceptable.

📌 Cell 10 — Testing Custom Input
Q23. What is the purpose of giving our own text to the model?

To check model performance manually.

Q24. Why do we use vectorizer.transform() for new text?

Because new text must also be converted into numbers.

Q25. What does the printed output show?

Whether the input text is predicted as positive or negative.

⭐ PART B — GENERAL VIVA QUESTIONS (ASKED BY EXAMINERS)

(Same style as previous topics)

Q26. What is document polarity classification?

It determines whether a document expresses a positive or negative sentiment.

Q27. Why do we clean text before training?

Because raw text contains noise that makes learning harder.

Q28. What is feature extraction in NLP?

Turning words into numbers so the computer can understand them.

Q29. Why is CountVectorizer used instead of raw text?

Models cannot understand words, only numbers.

Q30. What is a Bag-of-Words model?

A method where text is represented by word counts.

Q31. Why do we split data into train and test?

To check if our model can generalize.

Q32. What is accuracy?

Percentage of correct predictions.

Q33. Why do we remove stopwords?

They don’t change the sentiment.

Q34. Give examples of positive sentiment words.

good, excellent, happy, amazing

Q35. Give examples of negative sentiment words.

bad, terrible, hate, poor

⭐ PART C — HARD EXTERNAL QUESTIONS

(Asked to test deeper understanding)

Q36. What are limitations of Bag-of-Words?

It ignores word order and meaning.

Q37. What happens if dataset is unbalanced?

Model will favor the majority class.

Q38. What is overfitting?

When model memorizes training data but fails on new data.

Q39. Why is logistic regression commonly used in text classification?

It works well with high-dimensional sparse data.

Q40. What is the difference between CountVectorizer and TF-IDF?

TF-IDF gives more weight to important words and less weight to common ones.
