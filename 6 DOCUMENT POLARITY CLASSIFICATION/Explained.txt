Cell 1 — Import Libraries
Imports all required modules:
-  nltk + movie_reviews  →  load movie review dataset
-  TfidfVectorizer  →  convert text to TF-IDF features
-  MultinomialNB  →  Naïve Bayes classifier
-  accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report  →  evaluation
-  train_test_split  →  split data
-  random  →  shuffle documents
-  numpy  →  numeric operations


Cell 2 — Download Movie Review Dataset

Downloads the movie_reviews dataset from NLTK.
Contains 2000 movie reviews, each labelled pos or neg.


Cell 3 — Load Dataset
-  Reads all review files and assigns their labels
-  Stores them as (text, label) pairs
-  Shuffles the dataset
-  Separates into texts and labels
-  Prints first 2 samples to verify data


Cell 4 — Train-Test Split

-  Splits data into:
    -- 80% training
    -- 20% testing
with fixed random_state=42 for reproducibility.


Cell 5 — Convert Text to TF-IDF Features

-  Creates TF-IDF vectorizer (removes English stopwords, limits features to 3000)
-  Fits on training data and transforms it
-  Converts test data using the same vectorizer
-  Prints the resulting feature matrix shape


Cell 6 — Train Naïve Bayes Model

-  Creates Multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier
-  Trains the model on TF-IDF vectors and labels


Cell 7 — Evaluate Model

-  Predicts sentiment for test TF-IDF data
Prints:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion matrix
  - Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)


Cell 8 — Predict on Custom Inputs

-  Tests the trained model on 3 custom movie reviews:
-- Converts them to TF-IDF
-- Predicts sentiment using trained model
-- Prints each text with POS or NEG label


Cell 9 — Confusion Matrix Heatmap

-  Creates heatmap of confusion matrix using seaborn
-  X-axis: predicted labels
-  Y-axis: true labels
-  Helps visualize classification correctness
