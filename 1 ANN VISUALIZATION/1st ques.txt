TOPIC 1 — ANN VISUALIZATION
Cell-Wise Questions + Answers + General Q&A
🔵 CELL 1 — Importing Libraries
Cell Code (summary):

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier

Questions & Answers
1. Why do we import numpy?

To do mathematical operations easily.

2. Why do we import matplotlib?

To draw graphs and visualizations.

3. Why do we import MLPClassifier?

Because it is a ready-made ANN model in sklearn.

4. What type of ANN is MLPClassifier?

It is a feed-forward multilayer perceptron.

5. Is importing libraries necessary?

Yes, because without them we cannot use ANN functions.

🔵 CELL 2 — Creating Sample Data
Cell Code (summary):
X = np.array([...])
y = np.array([...])

Questions & Answers
1. What is X?

The input features we give to ANN.

2. What is y?

The output labels/class.

3. Why do we store inputs in an array?

So the model can read them in a structured way.

4. Why use numpy arrays instead of lists?

Because numpy is faster and better for ML.

5. What type of learning is this?

Supervised learning (because labels y exist).

🔵 CELL 3 — Creating the ANN Model
Cell Code (summary):
model = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(5,), activation='relu', random_state=1)

Questions & Answers
1. What does hidden_layer_sizes=(5,) mean?

The ANN has 1 hidden layer with 5 neurons.

2. Why use ReLU activation?

It is fast and prevents vanishing gradient.

3. What does random_state do?

Makes results same every time (reproducible).

4. Is this a deep neural network?

No, it is shallow (only 1 hidden layer).

5. Why do we create the model before training?

Because ANN structure must be defined first.

🔵 CELL 4 — Training / Fitting the Model
Cell Code (summary):
model.fit(X, y)

Questions & Answers
1. What does fit() do?

It trains the neural network.

2. What happens during training?

Weights and biases get updated.

3. What method is used to update weights?

Backpropagation.

4. Why do we need training?

So the model can learn patterns from data.

5. What output do we see after training?

Convergence message or warnings.

🔵 CELL 5 — Visualizing the ANN Weights
Cell Code (summary):
weights = model.coefs_
plt.imshow(weights[0])
plt.colorbar()

Questions & Answers
1. What does model.coefs_ represent?

It stores all weight values of the ANN.

2. Why do we use imshow()?

To display weight values as an image.

3. Why add colorbar()?

To understand which colors represent high or low weights.

4. What does bright color mean in weight visualization?

Higher weight value.

5. Why visualize weights?

To see how strongly neurons are connected.

🟣 GENERAL ANN QUESTIONS (From previous answer — INCLUDED as you requested)
1. What is ANN?

A model inspired by the brain with neurons and layers.

2. What is a neuron?

A calculation unit that processes input.

3. What is a weight?

A value that shows importance of an input.

4. What is bias?

A constant added to adjust output.

5. What is activation function?

Decides whether neuron fires or not.

6. What is backpropagation?

Training method to update weights.

7. What is a layer?

A group of neurons.

8. What is a hidden layer?

Middle layer where learning happens.

9. What is loss?

Difference between predicted and real value.

10. What is an epoch?

One round of full training.

11. Why visualize ANN?

To understand structure and learning.

12. What is ReLU?

An activation that outputs only positive values.

13. What is softmax used for?

Converting outputs to probabilities.

14. What is learning rate?

How fast model updates weights.

15. What is overfitting?

Model memorizes instead of learning.

16. What is underfitting?

Model is too simple; can’t learn.
