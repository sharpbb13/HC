CELL 1 ---  LIBRARIES

numpy, pandas  →  numerical & data handling
matplotlib  →  plotting graphs
load_iris  →  load Iris dataset
train_test_split  →  divide data into train & test
StandardScaler  →  normalize feature values
Sequential, Dense  →  to build the ANN model
plot_model  →  draw ANN architecture
os  →  file handling


CELL 2 – Load Iris Dataset

- Loads the Iris dataset using load_iris(as_frame=True)
- Converts it to a DataFrame using .frame.copy()
- Ensures the target column is present
- Renames the column to "Species" for clarity
- Displays first 5 rows
- Prints all column names
-- Confirms dataset is correctly loaded and clean.


Cell 3 – Separate Features & Target + Scaling + Train/Test Split

- X = numeric feature columns (sepal & petal measurements).
- y = species labels (0, 1, 2).
- Standardizes all feature values using StandardScaler.
- Splits data into 80% train and 20% test, with stratified class distribution.

CELL 4 – Build ANN Model

Creates a 3-layer Artificial Neural Network:
1.  Input Layer – Dense(12), activation = ReLU
2.  Hidden Layer – Dense(8), activation = ReLU
3.  Output Layer – Dense(3), activation = Softmax
(3 classes → setosa, versicolor, virginica)
- Model compiled with:
   - Optimizer: Adam
   - Loss: sparse_categorical_crossentropy (correct for integer labels)
   - Metric: accuracy
- Prints summary → number of neurons, parameters.


CELL 5 – Train the Model

Trains the network for 50 epochs, batch size 8.
Uses validation_data to track validation accuracy and loss.
Training output shows improvement with each epoch.


Cell 6 – Plot Accuracy/Loss Curves

Creates two graphs:
- Accuracy vs Epochs → shows training & validation accuracy
- Loss vs Epochs → shows how model error decreases
Useful for checking model performance and overfitting.


Cell 7 – Evaluate on Test Data

- Calculates test loss and test accuracy.
- Prints final accuracy (≈ 93%).
This tells how well the trained model performs on unseen data.


Cell 8 – Make a Sample Prediction

- Creates a single input sample.
- Scales it using the same StandardScaler.
- Predicts the species label using model.predict().
- Shows predicted class index, label, and class probabilities.


Cell 9 – Install Dependencies

- Installs Visualizer packages (pydot, graphviz) needed for ANN diagram.


Cell 10 – Save Network Diagram

- Tries to generate ANN diagram using ann_visualizer.
- If that fails, uses Keras plot_model.
- Saves diagram as network_diagram.png.


Cell 11 – Save Trained Model

- Saves the trained ANN model as assignment1_iris_ann.h5
- This allows reusing the model later without retraining.


ALGORITHM --

1. Start and import all required libraries.
2. Load the Iris dataset and prepare it (clean + separate features and target).
3. Normalize features and split data into training and testing sets.
4. Build and compile the ANN model (input, hidden, output layers).
5. Train the model, plot accuracy/loss, and evaluate on test data.
6. Make predictions and save the model/ANN diagram.
7. End
