PART A — CELL-WISE SMALL VIVA QUESTIONS (Short Q&A)

(These are tiny questions an external may ask while pointing at a specific cell.)

📌 Cell-1: Import Libraries

Q: Why do we import pandas?
A: To handle datasets in table form.

Q: Why is re module imported?
A: For regex-based text cleaning.

Q: Why do we import sklearn?
A: For preprocessing and classification.

📌 Cell-2: Load the Dataset

Q: Which function is used to load a CSV?
A: pd.read_csv().

Q: Why do we load Twitter data?
A: To analyze tweets and classify them.

Q: What is a DataFrame?
A: A table-like structure with rows and columns.

📌 Cell-3: Display First Few Rows

Q: Why use df.head()?
A: To view the first 5 rows.

Q: What do you check in first rows?
A: Format, missing values, columns.

📌 Cell-4: Clean Tweets (Remove hashtags, links, special characters)

Q: What is tweet cleaning?
A: Removing unwanted text parts.

Q: Why remove URLs?
A: They add noise and no meaning.

Q: What is re.sub() used for?
A: Replace patterns using regex.

📌 Cell-5: Lowercasing

Q: Why convert text to lowercase?
A: To maintain uniformity.

📌 Cell-6: Remove Stopwords

Q: What are stopwords?
A: Common words like "is", "the", "are".

Q: Why remove them?
A: They don’t add meaning.

📌 Cell-7: Tokenization

Q: What is tokenization?
A: Splitting text into words.

Q: Which library supports tokenization?
A: NLTK.

📌 Cell-8: Feature Extraction (TF–IDF / CountVectorizer)

Q: Why convert text into numbers?
A: ML models only accept numerical data.

Q: Name two text vectorizers.
A: CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer.

📌 Cell-9: Split Data (Train/Test)

Q: What is train_test_split?
A: Divides data into training and testing.

Q: Why test data needed?
A: To check model performance.

📌 Cell-10: Train KNN Model

Q: Why choose KNN classifier?
A: It’s simple and works well for text distances.

Q: What is K in KNN?
A: Number of nearest neighbors considered.

📌 Cell-11: Prediction

Q: What does prediction mean?
A: Model guessing class of new tweet.

Q: Function used to predict?
A: model.predict().

📌 Cell-12: Accuracy Score

Q: What is accuracy?
A: How many predictions are correct.

Q: Why do we calculate accuracy?
A: To measure model performance.

✅ PART B — OVERALL PROGRAM VIVA QUESTIONS (Medium Size Q&A)
1. What is the goal of Twitter Text Analysis?

Ans: To clean tweets, convert them into numerical features, and classify their sentiment/category.

2. Why do we need Text Cleaning?

Ans: Tweets contain noise like emojis, hashtags, links, and symbols. Cleaning helps model understand meaningful text.

3. What is the use of TF–IDF in text classification?

Ans: It converts text into numeric values based on importance of each word.

4. Why is KNN used in this experiment?

Ans: Because KNN classifies tweets by comparing similarity (distance) with other tweets.

5. What distance metric is used in KNN?

Ans: Mostly Euclidean or cosine distance for text data.

6. What is the importance of train-test split?

Ans: To ensure the model is tested on unseen data and avoid overfitting.

7. Why is lowercase conversion required?

Ans: Words like "India" and "india" should be treated the same.

✅ PART C — EXTERNAL DEEP VIVA QUESTIONS (Harder Q&A)
1. Explain the TF-IDF formula in simple words.

Ans:
TF = how many times a word appears in a tweet
IDF = how rare the word is in all tweets
TF–IDF = importance score of word

2. Why is KNN slow during prediction?

Ans: Because it compares new data with all training data points.

3. Why are stopwords removed in NLP?

Ans: They frequently appear but add no meaning → they reduce accuracy.

4. Difference between CountVectorizer and TF-IDF?

Ans:

CountVectorizer: counts how many times a word appears

TF-IDF: gives more weight to important words, reduces weight for common words

5. Why do tweets need special cleaning compared to normal text?

Ans: Tweets contain hashtags (#), mentions (@), links, emojis — more noise.

6. Why is tokenization necessary?

Ans: It breaks a sentence into words so that processing becomes easy.

7. Can KNN work without text vectorization?

Ans: No, because KNN only understands numbers, not raw text.
